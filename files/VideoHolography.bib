  abstract = {We have measured strong second-harmonic generation in N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA) thin films at a fundamental wavelength of 1550 nm. The second-order nonlinearity was determined to be (61 {$\pm$} 10) pm/V, comparable to the benchmark nonlinear crystal LiNbO3. The crystals are grown by cooling BNA from its melting point to room temperature in the presence of a temperature gradient. This gives rise to millimeter-sized crystals with thicknesses of several 100 nanometers. Our results are a first step towards the implementation of second-order nonlinear functionalities in silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits, where monolithically integrated strongly nonlinear crystals are lacking}

As such, metallic electrodes should be avoided, as they introduce significant parasitic losses. Transparent conductive oxides, on the other hand, offer reduced absorption due to their high bandgap and good conductivity due to their relatively high carrier concentration. Here, we present a metamaterial that enables electrodes to be in contact with the light active part of optoelectronic devices without the accompanying metallic losses and scattering. To this end, we use transparent conductive oxides and refractive index matched dielectrics as the metamaterial constituents. We present the metamaterial construction together with various characterization techniques that confirm the desired optical and electrical properties.},

  abstract = {With the slowing down of Moore's law, related to conventional scaling of integrated circuits, alternative technologies will require research effort for pushing the limits of new generations of electronic or photonic devices. Perovskite oxides with the ABO3 chemical formula have a very wide range of interesting intrinsic properties such as metal-insulator transition, ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity, piezoelectricity, ferromagnetic and superconductivity. For the integration of such oxides, it is of great interest to combine their properties with traditional electronic, memory and optical devices on the same silicon-based platform. In the context of high-speed chip-to-chip optical interconnects, compact high-resolution beam steering and video-rate RGB hologram generation require the integration of fast and efficient optical modulators on top of silicon CMOS devices. For these applications the integration of high quality electro-optical materials A defect-free material-stack deposition on silicon wafers is hence required. Among the possible materials options, barium titanate (BaTiO3) is one promising candidate due to its large intrinsic Pockels coefficients that can be obtained. In a first part of the talk, we will review the different options to integrate BaTiO3 on Silicon substrate though different templates to control the polarization direction and discuss the influence on the physical, electrical and optical properties. Then in the second section we will discuss the use of perovskites oxide in the field of topological based qubits which is one of the promising methods for realizing fault-tolerant computations. It is recognized that superconductor/topological insulator heterostructure interfaces may be a perfect host for the exotic "Majorana" particles. These have relevant topological protection nature as required for processing information. Therefore, the physics at the superconductor/topological insulator heterostructure interface need to be studied further, starting at the material level. In this work, a candidate material Barium Bismuthate (BBO) is studied utilizing the Oxide Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) process. The perovskite structure provides opportunity for easily tailored functionality through substitutional doping. Incorporation of potassium into the lattice of BBO results in a superconducting phase with Curie temperature as high as \textasciitilde{} 30K. In addition, BBO is according to DFT based studies, predicted to form topological surface states when doped with Fluorine. In our work, we integrate BBO perovskite on Si(001) substrate, using an epitaxially grown strontium titanate (STO) single-crystalline buffer layer and discuss the structural and chemical properties of the heterostructure will be established by utilizing physical characterization techniques such as AFM, and TEM in later stages. This will go hand in hand with the understanding of the ARPES studies and related surface reconstruction of BBO observed by RHEED as a criterion for the high-quality films.

  abstract = {Epitaxially grown strontium titanate (SrTiO3, STO) is an essential interlayer that enables the integration of functional perovskite oxides on large scale substrates of Si(001) thus enabling a wide range of applications in electronics and photonics. As a buffer layer, the crystallinity of STO directly impacts the properties of the oxides on top. In this study, we varied the molecular oxygen exposure amount prior to the STO growth to control the SrO/Si interface conditions. We show how the oxygen not only impacts the interface but also the crystallinity and more interestingly the stoichiometry in the STO films. With overexposure of molecular oxygen, the chemical binding states show the formation of SiOx, resulting in amorphous growth of the STO. In addition, the stoichiometry of Sr/(Sr+Ti) ratio changed dramatically as the exposure amount increased. The change of crystal quality and stoichiometry is also reflected in the optical constants, with a reduction n k observed. The change of stoichiometry is linked to the formation energy of different oxides, confirming the importance of controlling the oxygen amount in direct STO epitaxy on Si substrates. Finally, additional annealing shows an improvement by reducing the absorption of the STO films, which is crucial for photonic applications.}

The various formed interfaces showed large impact on the subsequent STO growth, including crystal quality and stoichiometry. The chemical binding states showed that the formation of thick SiOx interfacial layer was strongly correlated with the molecular oxygen exposure amount. More interestingly, the film stoichiometry is also strongly affected with overexposure, which resulted in optical properties degradation of the STO films. The STO optical constants, extracted from the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), exhibit obvious differences between crystalline and amorphous samples. Finally, post-deposition annealing was used to reduce the optical extinction, which is of primary importance for photonic applications.},

For such functional oxide systems, the pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) approach is one promising growth technique due to its precise stoichiometry control of the metals composing the perovskite crystal and higher oxygen environment compared to the classically used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) approach. In this article, we demonstrate a BTO epitaxial layer by PLD onto an Si(001) substrate thanks to a thin pseudomorphic SrTiO3 buffer layer grown by MBE. In our study, the various investigated PLD parameters show strong impacts on the BTO polarization orientation. Hence, adjusting the growth conditions allows control of the polarization orientation, which is crucial for both electronic and optical applications. In addition, lattice parameter changes of BTO layers are investigated using x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, which evidenced a correlation between mismatch relaxation and oxygen growth pressure. Finally, with the analysis of BTO C\textendash V curves, the polarization direction transition is demonstrated electrically.},

Among the possible material options, barium titanate (BaTiO3) is one promising candidate due to its large intrinsic Pockels coefficients. However, the reported Pockels coefficients in literature strongly depend on the obtained crystal lattice stress and axis orientation. In this work, we demonstrate a single-crystalline PLD-grown BaTiO3 (BTO) on top of a MBE-SrTiO3 /Si(001) pseudo-substrate. We investigated the orientation of the polarization axis of single-crystalline BTO under different growth conditions by X-ray diffraction. Larger Pockels coefficients are obtained for a-oriented BTO with its elongated axis lying parallel to sample surface. The control of growth conditions enables us to change polarization by selecting between c- and a-growth axis orientation with tetragonality control of single crystalline BTO films ranging from 0.98 to 1.02. For the a-BTO, the out-of-plane {$\omega$}-scan shows good crystalline quality with FWHM of 0.37\r{}. Using STEM and NBD, we relate the crystalline orientation switch to strain relaxation inside BTO films.},
